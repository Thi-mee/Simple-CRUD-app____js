Nice job.
Ensure you maintain proper folder structures always.

Add proper comments to your js code. This would server as proper documentation to other developers.

Nice work with the error handling.

Do not send a response inside a loop. Try as much as you can to avoid it.

I would love to see data validation in the next task.
